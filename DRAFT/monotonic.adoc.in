Deductive reasoning is non-monotonic inference in which the conclusion is of greater generality than the premises .

non-monotonic logics are devised to capture and represent defeasible inferences .

A monotonic consequence relation means that an formula to a theory never produces a reduction of its set of consequences.  

A monotonic logic cannot handle reasoning by default (consequences may be derived only because of lack of evidence of the contrary) .

The principle of explosion is the logical thinking law that once a contradiction has been asserted, any proposition (including it's negations) can be inferred from it; this is known as deductive explosion .
