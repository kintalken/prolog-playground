## `nth__oldest__child`

### question


###### ./src/suite/database.prolog

```
#include ./src/suite/database.prolog
```

What I would like to do is define a query that returns the Nth oldest child of an person, .e.g. in this case with person `john`  1st oldest would be `maggie` , 2nd oldest would be `martinez` , and 3rd oldest would be `mary` .

### answer

1. make a `QUERY` that get's all children of the `PERSON0` .
2. form the result so that `AGE` comes first in the term .
3. use `setof` for the query so that the results are sorted by `AGE` youngest to oldest .
4. reverse the youngest to oldest list to get an oldest to youngest list .
5. obtain the `NTH` element from the list of oldest to youngest .

###### ./src/suite/nth__oldest__child.prolog

#include ./src/suite/nth__oldest__child.prolog
